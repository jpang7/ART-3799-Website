            Notes on a new approach in sculpture
        </h3>
        <p>
            The following pictures showcase my progress in the famous styrofoam project for Joanna's Intro to Sculpture class. 
            I put them here because they represent a new artistic tool I want to explore-- to leverage the repetition of geometric shapes
            more explicitly, rather than having to render every abstraction by hand. This experiment in sculpture coincides with a desire
            to make abstract works with Processing that I would not be able to render by hand.

        <h3>
            Contrasting three artists working with digital: Liss LaFleur, Zach Blas, Chitra Ganesh
        </h3>
        <p>
            Liss LaFleur seemed much more in tune with digital media and seemed to have explanations for why we would want to use it. Her philosophy and what she considered integral to her art seemed to justify her use of digital media. She also had a wide range of technologies at her disposal, including a very robust VR Tiltbrush environment and projections on thin strips of glass. I was quite excited to see the projections on glass, especially the variant of having them be many thin strips-- I ended up wanting to try the exact setup myself, except with my own projections. Also of note: although the works clearly touched on contemporary topics in digital media such as data visualization, virtual reality, immersion, etc, the works felt less of a commentary on digital media than most digital works tend to be. All the technology seemed to serve a greater conceptual, political purpose, while commentary about the digitization of our world seemed like a message received in passing. <br/>

I joined the lunch with Zach Blas and was happy to hear about his day-to-day experience as an artist, along with the logistical issues he ran into. I liked that the talk was characterized not by very specific logistic advice, but rather an overview of what aspects of life affect an artist the most. I was surprised to hear that he basically had to drop his ventures in art when he studied at Duke, while moving to London made the necessity for his art much deeper. I think I should have asked more about how his PhD in philosophy helped him with his art specifically, since he discussed how his PhD affected his critical thinking more generally. Zach was very frank about the need to have representation by critics or gallery, which I appreciated. Contrasting Blas and LaFleur is interesting since Blas’ commentary focused much more on an awareness of our digital future, especially in Icosahedron. Also interesting was the willingness to outsource-- he talked about hiring his website administrator, but it looks like for many of his digital works he would get a team of technicians to launch his idea. I may run into a problem where although I am able to program and implement my vision myself, it might make more sense to delegate. <br/>

The first thing I reflected on regarding Chitra Ganesh’s work was the amount of drawing she did, and the extent to which drawing permeated her practice. I think she was really influenced by the style of cartooning, more than she seemed to convey in her talk. She cited the clear influence of cartoons in her comics, but the influence really revealed itself in her animated works. Her animations were, while quite impactful, very cartoon-like in the following sense: with animation you have the ability to decompose quite freely an image into very small parts, even to disintegrate. By contrast, Ganesh’s animations were very discrete, since she took cutouts of pieces from traditional art. Her practice in her animations touched on something that I always did want to do, which was to analyze one of those sprawling, detailed traditional narrative works and appropriate some of their components.

        <h3>
            Response to Sam Van Aken’s Lecture
        </h3>
        <p>
            I was amazed at how Sam’s “Tree of 40 Fruit” project brought him to rarified status– he held the most fruit of a certain kind, maybe second to specialized university departments. His work caught the world’s notice. It seems this happened for two reasons.

            The first reason was “himself”: His farming background presented him an opportunity to look at making art in a different way, and I think since he was so open and conceptually oriented he was able to seize the opportunity. From what I saw in the short lecture, he certainly was more conceptually oriented. He was more willing to explain the conceptual underpinnings of his work, which started with a research question, or an interesting phrase. Contrast this with Kota Ezawa’s lecture, who seemed to have come up with project ideas by visually playing with and remixing his animation style. Sam was also very willing to take on large-scale projects from what I saw– he was open to taking the radio tower, wanted to build artificial clouds, handling multiple 40 fruit trees at a time, hosting workshops, etc.
            
            The second is the nature of fruit– these fruit can germinate and grow so effortlessly. I kept thinking about programming and its relation to DNA when he talked about preserving varieties and the various different tastes in certain fruits he found. I thought there could be an interesting digital project or game that simulates how seeds can spread and how mutations occur. Although the fruit is more than 2000 years old, it still has the same hard-wired material, the encoded DNA. I might really research it. Even without the conceptual connection Sam made between food and culture I would have been intrigued.

        <h3>
            Response to Kota Ezawa’s Talk
        </h3>
        <p>
            Firstly, I’d like to note how surprised I was at how consistent Ezawa’s rendering of characters was across his career. In addition it was insightful to see how Ezawa completely ran with a visual form that the animation technology of his time forced him to take and kept forming variations on his style. It seems like he was more purely a visual thinker, since his projects interlaced their messages with the medium of animation first and foremost. He also explained his inspiration for a new piece or project as an experiment in visual form.

            The fact that he made animations by studying photographs and videos, I assume, allowed him to make his animations more lively. Although they were clearly not hyper-realistic, the animations felt accurate. For example, the Beatles animation featured lots of random jiggling movement– Ezawa abstracted that random movement captured on camera and emphasized it– it looks more realistic. 
            
            I also want to note that the OJ Simpson piece might have been the more poetic out of the animations. The camera (or the focus of the animated piece) paned and zoomed into awkward, unusual areas and was more compelling. I had to think about why those areas were chosen as focus. The piece with the movies was certainly more visually thrilling. But the Simpson piece seemed to convey more in terms of communicating the tension and psychology of the courtroom.
